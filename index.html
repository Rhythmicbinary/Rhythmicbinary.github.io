    <h1>Mahdi Salehi - Python Developer</h1>

    <p>
        I'm Mahdi Salehi, a dynamic Python enthusiast and seasoned framework developer. With over five years of dedicated
        self-study, I've honed my Python skills through hands-on projects, mastering the language and its applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        In my current role as a Python programmer and framework developer, I've played a pivotal part in tailoring
        frameworks to meet our organization's unique needs. I find joy in crafting solutions that are not just functional
        but also scalable and impactful.
    </p>

    <p>
        My expertise extends to asynchronous programming and microservices, where I leverage Celery to implement and
        manage distributed task queues. FastAPI and SlowAPI are my go-to frameworks for designing high-performance APIs,
        adding an extra layer of finesse to my skill set.
    </p>

    <p>
        Message queue systems, especially RabbitMQ, are my playground. I thrive on ensuring seamless communication and
        data flow within complex architectures, fostering the smooth operation of distributed systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a database management aficionado, I bring proficiency in PostgreSQL, contributing to the creation of robust
        data storage solutions. Redis is my go-to for optimizing data retrieval and storage, and Docker is my trusted
        ally for streamlined deployments.
    </p>

    <p>
        I champion Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) processes, automating workflows to ensure
        efficient and reliable software delivery pipelines. Beyond coding, I'm actively involved in shaping software
        architecture, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
    </p>

    <p>
        With over four years of Linux experience, I navigate and manage systems effortlessly in this open-source
        environment. My journey in software development is marked by a commitment to continuous learning, technical
        excellence, and adaptability.
    </p>

    <p>
        Eager to connect with fellow professionals, tech enthusiasts, and innovative minds. Let's collaborate, exchange
        ideas, and explore opportunities in the dynamic world of software development.
